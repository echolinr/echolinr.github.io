- I am a tech-savvy technical writer with ability to write API documentation with code samples.
- With extensive web development experience (HTML/CSS, Java/JavaScript, Rest API, Node JS), I create developer guides and online help for external API audiences.

- I enjoy working in a fast-faced, cross-functional and agile development environment.
