# Deploy Your Device
This chapter introduces how a firewall works and its most commonly used scenarios. Understanding the system structure, basic elements and flow chart will help you in better organizing your network and making the most of the firewall product.

> How a Firewall Works

A firewall has more than one deployment scenarios. Each scenario applies to one environment requirement. The usual deployment modes are:

> Deploy Transparent Mode 

Transparent mode is a situation when the IT administrator does not wish to change his existing network settings. In transparent mode, the firewall is invisible for the network. No IP address configuration is needed, the firewall only provides security features. 

> Deploy Routing Mode 

Route mode applies when the firewall also offers routing and NAT functions. In route mode, firewall connects two networks, typically an internal network and Internet, and firewall interfaces are configured with IP addresses. 

> Deploy Mix Mode 

If a firewall has Layer-2 interfaces and Layer-3 interfaces, the firewall is in the Mixed mode.

> Deploy Tap Mode 

When an IT administrator wants only monitor, IPS or statistics functions from a firewall, not a gateway device,using tap mode is the right choice. In tap mode, firewall is not directly connected within the network.
