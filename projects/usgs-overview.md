## Why earthquake aftershocks matter?

In the past 15 years, timedependent
earthquake probabilities based on a generic short-term
clustering model have been made publicly available in near-real
time during major earthquake sequences.

These forecasts describe
the probability and number of events that are, on average, likely to
occur following a mainshock of a given magnitude, but are not
tailored to the particular sequence at hand and contain no
information about the likely locations of the aftershocks.

## What makes our model special?
Our
model builds upon the basic principles of this generic forecast
model in two ways: it recasts the forecast in terms of the probability
of strong ground shaking, and it combines an existing timeindependent
earthquake occurrence model based on fault data
and historical earthquakes5 with increasingly complex models
describing the local time-dependent earthquake clustering.

The
result is a time-dependent map showing the probability of strong
shaking anywhere in California within the next 24 hours. The
seismic hazard modelling approach we describe provides a better
understanding of time-dependent earthquake hazard, and increases
its usefulness for the public, emergency planners and the media.

The 2014 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)â€“United States National
Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) provides probabilistic
forecasts of locations, magnitudes, and rates of future natural
(tectonic) earthquakes, as well as estimates of long-term (based
on a 50-year horizon) ground-shaking hazard
