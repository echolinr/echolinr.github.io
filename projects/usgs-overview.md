## What this website about?

This website shows the probabilistic forecasts of natural ground-shaking hazard in the form a near-real time intuitive map. 

The forecasts describe the probability and magnitude of events that are likely to occur about the given location. 

The theorectical model builds upon two principles: the probability of strong gound shaking, and timeindependent earthquake occurence (based on fault data and historical earthquakes).

The 2014 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)â€“United States National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) provides the forecast.

## Who is this website for?
Anyone who wish to get the statistic data and visual image of realtime earthquake forecast. It is specifically designed for the public, emergency planners and the media.

Developers can leverage our APIs to get probability data by passing geolocation, time and magnitude.

## Terminologies

PGA: Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) describes the strength of the
maximum ground shaking at a location as a fraction of the force of
gravity (g).

MMI: Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) describes the strength of
ground shaking felt at a location and the level of damage to buildings.
