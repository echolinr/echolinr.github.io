## What this website about?

This website shows the probabilistic forecasts of natural ground-shaking hazard in the form a near-real time intuitive map. 

The forecasts describe the probability and magnitude of events that are likely to occur about the given location. 

The theorectical model builds upon two principles: the probability of strong gound shaking, and timeindependent earthquake occurence (based on fault data and historical earthquakes).

The 2014 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)–United States National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) provides the forecast.

## Who is this website for?
Anyone who wishes to get the statistic data and visual image of realtime earthquake forecasts. It is specifically designed for the public, emergency planners and the media.

Developers can leverage our APIs to get probability data by passing geolocation, time and magnitude.

## Terminologies

There are two types of earthquake intenstity measures: PGA and MMI.

**PGA**: Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) describes the strength of the
maximum ground shaking at a location as a fraction of the force of
gravity (g). 
Generally speaking,
* 0.001 g (0.01 m/s²) – perceptible by people
* 0.02  g (0.2  m/s²) – people lose their balance
* 0.50  g – very high; well-designed buildings can survive if the duration is short.[7]

**MMI**: Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) describes the strength of
ground shaking felt at a location and the level of damage to buildings.
The MMI scale quantifies the effects of an earthquake on the Earth's surface, humans, objects of nature, and man-made structures on a scale from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction).
